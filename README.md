## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How & Why
**Sask Wildfire Bot** is a [Twitter bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_bot) dedicated to **propogating Saskatchewan wildfire information**.  
It is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and uses the following packages:
- [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) to pull information from the [Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency](https://saskatchewan.ca/fire)
- [pdf2image](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image) to convert pdfs into jpg images
- [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to set environment variables from a `.env` file

_The Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency_ does a great job updating wildfire status information [here](https://www.saskpublicsafety.ca/emergencies-and-response/wildfire-status)... But most of the information including Active Wildfire Map, Current Fire Bans, Daily Fire Danger Map, and Fire Danger Map Tomorrow is stored in a _.pdf_ format.

This bot allows people to subscribe to notifications from [@SaskWildfire](https://twitter.com/SaskWildfire) for up to date wildfire information, rather than feeling the need to navigate to the [Wildfire Status]((https://www.saskpublicsafety.ca/emergencies-and-response/wildfire-status)) page and download _.pdf_ files daily.


## üíª Dependencies & Installation
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

     - run `brew install poppler` on macOS
     - (this is required for pdf conversion using pdf2image)
- Twitter Authentication Tokens via a [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/)
     - Create a `.env` file with these tokens in the root of the directory
     - ([Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) has good documentation on retrieving those [here](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/auth_tutorial.html))
